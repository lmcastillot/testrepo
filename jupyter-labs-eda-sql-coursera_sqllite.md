<h1 align=center><font size = 5>Assignment: SQL Notebook for Peer Assignment</font></h1>

Estimated time needed: **60** minutes.

## Introduction
Using this Python notebook you will:

1.  Understand the Spacex DataSet
2.  Load the dataset  into the corresponding table in a Db2 database
3.  Execute SQL queries to answer assignment questions 


## Overview of the DataSet

SpaceX has gained worldwide attention for a series of historic milestones. 

It is the only private company ever to return a spacecraft from low-earth orbit, which it first accomplished in December 2010.
SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars wheras other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because Space X can reuse the first stage. 


Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. 

This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.

This dataset includes a record for each payload carried during a SpaceX mission into outer space.


### Download the datasets

This assignment requires you to load the spacex dataset.

In many cases the dataset to be analyzed is available as a .CSV (comma separated values) file, perhaps on the internet. Click on the link below to download and save the dataset (.CSV file):

## Tasks

Now write and execute SQL queries to solve the assignment tasks.

**Note: If the column names are in mixed case enclose it in double quotes
   For Example "Landing_Outcome"**

### Task 9


##### List the records which will display the month names, failure landing_outcomes in drone ship ,booster versions, launch_site for the months in year 2015.

**Note: SQLLite does not support monthnames. So you need to use  substr(Date, 6,2) as month to get the months and substr(Date,0,5)='2015' for year.**



```python
%sql select substr(Date, 6,2) as month , Booster_Version,Landing_Outcome, Launch_site  FROM SPACEXTABLE where Landing_Outcome like 'Failur%' and substr(Date,0,5)='2015' 
```

     * sqlite:///my_data1.db
    Done.





<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>month</th>
            <th>Booster_Version</th>
            <th>Landing_Outcome</th>
            <th>Launch_Site</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>

            <td>Failure (drone ship)</td>
            <td>CCAFS LC-40</td>
        </tr>

### Task 10




##### Rank the count of landing outcomes (such as Failure (drone ship) or Success (ground pad)) between the date 2010-06-04 and 2017-03-20, in descending order.



```python
%sql select Landing_Outcome, count(Landing_Outcome) as Count_land FROM SPACEXTABLE where Date between '2010-06-04'and '2017-03-20' group by Landing_Outcome order by Count_land desc
```

     * sqlite:///my_data1.db
    Done.





<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Landing_Outcome</th>
            <th>Count_land</th>
        </tr>
